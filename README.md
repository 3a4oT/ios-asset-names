# Guide for Naming Assets in iOS Projects

This guide outlines [naming conventions](#naming) to help graphic designers and developers manage a large number of assets (images) prepared for iOS projects. 

Your input is welcome: [issues](https://github.com/dkhamsing/ios-asset-names/issues), [pull requests](https://github.com/dkhamsing/ios-asset-names/pulls), or [twitter](https://twitter.com/dkhamsing).

## Folders

* If you are using [Asset Catalogs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-image_catalog-1.0/Recipe.html) introduced with Xcode 5, folders and names are created *automatically* but you might want name assets (image sets) yourself so keep reading. 
* Use a main folder to store the assets (usually named `assets` or `images`).
	* Option 1: Keep all assets in one folder, this may seem radical but it could work in conjunction with [prefixing](#prefixing).
	* Option 2: Use subfolders
		* Break the user interface in sections / logical groupings and have subfolders representing them (agree on the subfolder structure and names when reviewing the mockups/designs). However subfolders can create problems with asset name [uniqueness](#uniqueness).
		* Format: `images`/`subfolder`/

```
images/about/
images/misc/
images/share/
images/top/
images/tutorial/ 
images/web-browser/

```

* Use lower case.
* No spaces or special characters (use dashes).



For universal apps, it might be worthwhile to add one more folder level named after the device: `images`/`iphone`/`subfolder`, `images`/`ipad`/`subfolder` (see Apple's [device modifier convention](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/App-RelatedResources/App-RelatedResources.html), especially for launch images).

## Asset Type

* Use the [PNG format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) when possible
	* Determine if transparency is needed ([UIButton tap issue](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17368803/how-can-i-make-uibutton-respond-to-touch-on-the-transparent-areas-of-a-png-image))
* Create 1x and 2x assets in the same folder 
* Add `@2x` at the end of the [retina asset name](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/HighResolutionOSX/Optimizing/Optimizing.html)

```
asset.png
asset@2x.png
```

To save disk space or time, one can omit the 1x or 2x asset: the system automatically scales up or down for the appropriate resolution (in particular, you could provide only 2x assets when targeting retina devices). 

## Naming

### Uniqueness

An important attribute of an asset name is uniqueness.

* This prevents confusion: for example having two different `share` assets (say one for iPhone and one for iPad, or one in a main view and one in a detail view).
* More importantly, while it is possible in Xcode to have two files of the same names in different folders, you can only reference one of them using `+ (UIImage *)imageNamed:(NSString *)name`.

### Prefixing

Prefixing is optional but it ensures that asset names are unique across the project.

* Prefix the asset with a 2 or 3 letter prefix representing the `project` so you can tell which project it belongs to.
* Add another prefix using the `folder` name so you can tell which folder it belongs to. 
* Format: `project`-`folder`-`asset-name`.png

```
ss-intro-arrow-right.png 
bpc-intro-arrow-right.png 
```

### Conventions

* **The asset name describes the icon**, not the function of the icon (when possible, see [special cases](#special-cases)).
* Use lower case.
* No spaces or special characters (use dashes).

**Examples**
```
ss-rack-minus.png 
ss-top-bars.png 
ss-tree-check.png
```

**Not**

```
delete.png 
menu.png
selected.png
```

While CamelCase is the convention in Objective-C, it does not necessarily mean it needs to be applied to asset names (by all means feel free to use it if you prefer `SSRackMinus.png`).

#### Notable

* `chevron` for `>`
* `caret` for `‚ñ∫`

#### Special cases 

Sometimes the name is well represented by its function (refer to [Charbase](http://www.charbase.com/21bb-unicode-clockwise-open-circle-arrow) for Unicode).

* `refresh` for `open circle arrow` (‚ü≥ U+21BB)  
* `edit` for `pencil` (‚úé U+270E) 
* `search` for `magnifying glass` (üîç U+1F50D) 
* `user` for `bust in silhouette` (üë§ U+1F464) 
* `comment` for `speech balloon` (üí¨ U+1F4AC)

#### Collisions 

Should two assets have the same name, add a qualifier at the end.


##### Color qualifer

```
ss-top-plus-pink.png
ss-top-plus-gray.png
```

##### Shape qualifer

* `*-square` 
* `*-circle`
* `*-o` for outline

```
ss-top-arrow-right-circle.png
ss-top-arrow-right-square.png
```

##### Combine shapes

* `*-square-o` for square outline

##### Direction qualifer (always at the end)

* `*-right`
* `*-left`
* `*-up`, etc

```
ss-top-arrow-right.png
ss-top-arrow-square-right.png
```

### Spelling

In the US, we would favor American over British spelling (sorry M'lady).

**Examples**
```
ss-top-hanger-gray.png  
ss-tree-color-swatch.png 
```

**Not**

```
hanger-grey.png  
colour-swatch.png 
```

### Abbreviations

Do not abbreviate.

**Examples**
```
ss-share-facebook.png 
ss-share-twitter.png  
```

**Not**
```
fb.png
tw.png
```
